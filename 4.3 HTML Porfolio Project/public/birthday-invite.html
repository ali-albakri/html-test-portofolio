<h1><Samp>You are chosen to attend thy birthday!</Samp></h1>
<h2><Samp>Thee Birthday shalt occur in the fourteenth of September, 2 PM.</Samp></h2>
<hr/>
<p>Now my friend, as I was generous enough to send you this personally, I expect some ahem... things from you. Yep, I'm going to be serving you and entertaining you for the day, so I need something in return (if you know what I mean)</p>

<h2><Samp>What I expect:</Samp></h2>
<ol>
    <li>I was just joking, my actual gift is your attendance (its more important to me than anything in the world)</li>
    <li>Please try your best not to fight or stir drama, we all came to have fun; so just let things slide y'know...</li>
    <li>Just enjoy your time here, and don't forget to go grab an ice cone!</li>
